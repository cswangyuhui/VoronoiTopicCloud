Paper "Exploring trending topics of social media text with VoronoiTopicCloud" source code

## INTRODUCTION
Enormous volume of data on social media platforms such as Weibo and Twitter are being generated every day, it is difficult to extract meaningful information from these large amount of text in a short time. Microblogs collected from Weibo on a certain topic may consist of numerous conversation threads about relevant subtopics. However, it is difficult to discern these subtopics if the data is visualized as a single word cloud because words appear in discrete form and thereâ€™s no context next to them in word cloud. To help identify subtopics under a broader topic, we introduce VoronoiTopicCloud, a novel technique for visualizing the opinions in a large social media text collection. VoronoiTopicCloud is implemented as a lightweight application that runs in the browser.
